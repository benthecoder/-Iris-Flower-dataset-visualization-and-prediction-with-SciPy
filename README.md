# Iris Flower Dataset visualization and prediction using KNN algorithm
This project was inspired from the [article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/) posted by machine learning mastery.

This was my first Machine Learning project using Python, more specifically the SciPy package.

In this tutorial, I learnt to

1. Download and install Python SciPy and get the most useful package for machine learning in Python.
2. Load a dataset and understand itâ€™s structure using statistical summaries and data visualization.
3. Create 6 machine learning models, pick the best and build confidence that the accuracy is reliable.


## According to the article, a machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:

1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Present Results.

## Step-by-step tutorial
1. Installing the Python and SciPy platform.
2. Loading the dataset.
3. Summarizing the dataset.
4. Visualizing the dataset.
5. Evaluating some algorithms.
6. Making some predictions.

## 6 different algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## What I Learned
I was suprised how easy it was to actually perform prediction and the feasability of SciPy packages in Python. Although I did not type all the code by myself, nor did I understand everything in the code. It was a good introduction as to how prediction machine learning is performed.
